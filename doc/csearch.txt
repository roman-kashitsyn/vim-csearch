INTRODUCTION                                                         *csearch*

This plugin integrates Google's codesearch tool (https://github.com/google/codesearch)
as a grep-like utility.  It allows one to index your files without leaving Vim
and populate |quickfix| list or |location-list| with `csearch` search results.

:Cindex {path}...                                                    *:Cindex*

  Prepares the trigram index to use by |:Csearch|.
  If paths are specified, adds directory trees named by each path to the
  index.  If invoked with no paths, it reindexes the paths that have
  already been added, in case the files have changed. 

:Csearch {pattern} [{filepattern}]                                   *:Csearch*

  Search the index for the specified RE2 regexp {pattern}.
  If the {filepattern} is specified, the search is limited to files whose
  names match the {filepattern} RE2 regexp.
  The search results are displayed in a |quickfix| window.
  Csearch uses the index stored in $CSEARCHINDEX or, if that variable is unset
  or empty, $HOME/.csearchindex. 

:Lcsearch {pattern} [{filepattern}]                                 *:Lcsearch*

  Just like |:Csearch|, but instead of the |quickfix| list, results are placed
  in the current |location-list|.
